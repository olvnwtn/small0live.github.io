My research focuses on how teams learn, make decisions, and collaborate effectively in sociotechnical systems. 

I study teams and technology, examining how training, expertise, and cognition shape performance in contexts ranging from human-AI teaming and human-robot interaction to open source and scientific software development. I also investigate how teams use computational technologies, including AI tools, to coordinate, innovate, and solve problems. 

One of my current research projects, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy via a grant from Argonne National Laboratory, centers on advancing AI-enabled scientific computing ecosystems that integrate software and human expertise to accelerate discovery.
